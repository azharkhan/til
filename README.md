# TIL

We're all passionate about learning, and learning is something we're all actively engaged in. However, our (especially) my memory is pretty bad in retaining things that I learn, and most of the information that I retain is through daily practice and engagement.

This is a collection of short things that I learned on a day-to-day basis, and is a reference for me personally, as well as anyone else who would find it beneficial.
